# Best Coding Practices
- After creating a function, don't just start typing out the code, first write down the tasks needed to be done with comments, then tackle each comment.

For example: 
```tsx
async function createSnippet(){
  //This needs to be a server action
  //Check user's inputs and make sure they are valid
  //Create a new record in the database
  //Redirect the user to a page, like root page.
}
```

## For Problem Solving
- Write down your plan and approach for solving the problem with comments first before writing the code.
