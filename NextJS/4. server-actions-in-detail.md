# Server Actions in Great Detail

- For creating a snippet in create page, we used server action in the page. We can't do that for the snippet-edit-page.
- This is because **server actions cannot be defined in client components.** In the edit page, there is `use-client` at the top. To dumb it down, a `use-server` won't work if there is a `use-client` at the top.

## Options to use Server actions in Client page
### Option 1: Define Server action in a separate server component and pass it as props to client component
- The problem with this is as that Server components cannot pass event handlers down to client components.
```tsx
export default function SnippetEditPage(){
  async function updateSnippet(id, code){
    `use-server`;
    //code to update snippet
  }
  return (<SnippetEditForm onSubmit={updateSnippet}>);
}
```

### Option 2: Collect multiple server actions in a separate file that will only contain server actions.
- This has better code organization and promotes code reusability.

1. Create an `index.ts` file in `src/actions/` directory. (Name can be anything like action.ts too)
```ts
'use-server';
import {db} from '@/db';
export async function editSnippet(code:String, formData:FormData){
  //update Snippet
}
```

#### Calling Server actions from a client component
Option 1:
- We can use this option when we want to tie a server action to when a form is submitted or somthing like that.
- This will work event if the client doesn't have JS enabled.
- Use bind function built into JS to pass state into the call to server action.
- With bind function any arguments you pass in after 1st argument kind of reloads the function.

```tsx
'use-client';
import * as actions from 'actions';
function ClientComponent(){
  const [code, setCode] = useState('');
  //Make sure 'editSnippet' gets called with the code from editor
  const editSnippetAction = actions.editSnippet.bind(null,code);

  return <form action={editSnippetAction}>
    <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
  </form>
}
```
- In client, first argument will be the bound argument.
- Second argument wil be 'FormData' containing data form if exists.

Option 2:
- We can use this method when we want to call server action whenever a user types or drags and drops or on a timer.

```tsx
import {startTransition} from 'react';
import * as actions from 'actions';

function ClientComponent(){
  const [code, setCode] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    startTransition (async () => {
      await actions.editSnippet(code);
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Submit</button>
}

//in actions.ts
'use server'
export async function editSnippet(code:string){
  //update snippet
}
```

- The purpose of `startTransition` here is that to make sure we have updated Data before we attempt to navigate.

## Deleting in prisma
```ts
export async function deleteSnippet(id:number){
  await db.snippet.delete({
    where: {id},
  });
}
```
