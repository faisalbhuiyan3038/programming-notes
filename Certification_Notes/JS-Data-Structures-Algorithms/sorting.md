# Sorting

Code for Bubble Sort:
```js
const bubbleSort = (array) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length - 1; j++) {
      console.log(array, array[j], array[j + 1]);

      if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
        const temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j + 1];
        array[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
```

- Selection sort works by finding the smallest value in the array, then swapping it with the first value in the array. Then, it finds the next smallest value in the array, and swaps it with the second value in the array. It continues iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.

- The last sorting algorithm you will implement is the insertion sort. This algorithm works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of the list. It begins the sorted array with the first element. Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backward into the sorted array until it is in a sorted position, and so on.
