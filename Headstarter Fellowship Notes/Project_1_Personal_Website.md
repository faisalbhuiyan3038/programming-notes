### How do I go from a 0-100 Software Engineer?

You need to put your time between Project Building, Interview Prep and Resume.

In terms of Project building, best way to get started is with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap. Understand the react libraries, typescript, nodeJS, ExpressJs, nextJS.

Then, go into use different APIs, openapi API, opendata API, stripe API. Understand how to create CRUD app.

After that, go into building your own API and publish it.

Then, go into AWS, Azure. Learn different functionalities of cloud.

Most cloud services are three things:

- Databases to store data
- Storage to store files, videos etc
- Compute: how to host your own code, how to serve up your own server.

Then, learn everything about the AI stack. No need to learn creating AI, just learn to integrate AI api.

## AI

Since AI is taking over the world, you wanna give off a vibe that you are ready for the new world, you are going to make the best use of AI and make it work for you. That's the vibe you wanna give people from your resume.

How to learn all the numerous AI architectural stuffs and topics?

- Spend one or two week on 1 specific topic, no more
- Bring over two or more skills from that week onto the next project.

## Resume

Use templates, don't start from scratch. A great website is <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5UP</a>.

For better design or functionalities, you can download <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/theme/">bootstrap templates</a> as well.

Your goal for your landing page should not be 'technical effort'. Your goal should be 'high signal' and 'high intent'.

The words you put on your page really matter. Your coding skills should be represented through your projects not your portfolio.

Beginning Steps:

- Delete whatever you can from the initial template.

For hosting, we will use Github. Note that Github only allows one public site per account, so you may need to create a new account when necessary.

For Domain Names:

- You wanna use something professional like (.com,.dev). It enhances your personal brand.
- You can use hosting sites like GoDaddy
- You wanna have something short like mark.ai or mark.dev or something like a username.

After you deploy the page on Github, you can connect a custom domain for the website.

- Buy a domain, go to something like manage your domain.
- Then, update DNS configuration. or Manage DNS settings.

For adding Google Analytics, you add script tags in the header and at the end of your html file.

Another great analytical tool is "Hotjar". It can show you which portion of your site has the most traffic.

Most products use mixpanel or posthog.
